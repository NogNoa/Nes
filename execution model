each operation has 3 parts
adressing:
    load value to address based on the addressing mode
    if operation is with memory source: load value to operand from read based on address
    if operation with N source: load to operand from program.
operate:
    either on A and operand, or just operand, saving the result in operand
    load the value from operand to destination
    if operation is with memory destination: use write based on address
update flags:
    update flags based on operand

each operation therfore has:
    src: name of a register, or M for memory, or N for next bytes in PC
    dest: "
    operation: string
    addressing mode

execution unit has internal registers: Operand, and Address

operations could call additional function, such as pushes and pulls
